## Features

- **Multiple Log Levels**: RustLogs (RLG) supports a comprehensive set of log levels, including `ALL`, `DEBUG`, `DISABLED`, `ERROR`, `FATAL`, `INFO`, `NONE`, `TRACE`, `VERBOSE`, and `WARNING`, allowing you to control the granularity of your logs.

- **Structured Log Formats**: The library provides structured log formats that are easy to parse and filter, enabling efficient analysis and troubleshooting of your application's logs.

- **Extensive Output Format Compatibility**: RustLogs (RLG) supports a wide range of output formats, including 
  - **Common Event Format (CEF)** - A standardized log format developed by ArcSight for the exchange of event information between security devices and applications.
  - **Extended Log Format (ELF)** - A log format that extends the Common Log Format (CLF) with additional fields to provide more detailed information about web server requests.
  - **Graylog Extended Log Format (GELF)** - A log format designed for use with the Graylog log management system, which allows for the transmission of log messages over a network.
  - **JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)** - A lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate.
  - **NCSA Common Log Format (CLF)** - A standardized log format used by web servers to log client requests, including information such as the client IP address, request method, and response status code.
  - **W3C Extended Log File Format (W3C)** - A log format developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that extends the Common Log Format (CLF) with additional fields for more detailed logging of web server requests.
  - **Syslog Format** - A standardized log format used by various network devices and applications to send event messages to a centralized logging server.
  - **Apache Access Log Format** - A log format used by the Apache web server to log client requests, including information such as the client IP address, request method, and response status code.
  - **Logstash Format** - A log format used by the Logstash data processing pipeline, which allows for the collection, parsing, and forwarding of log data from various sources.
  - **Log4j XML Format** - A log format used by the Log4j logging framework, which allows for the structured logging of events in an XML format.
  - **NDJSON (Newline Delimited JSON)** - A log format where each log message is represented as a JSON object on a separate line, making it easy to parse and process log data in a streaming fashion.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Customize the behavior of RustLogs (RLG) to suit your application's needs. You can easily configure the log file path, log levels, and output formats to match your requirements.

- **Asynchronous Logging**: RustLogs (RLG) supports asynchronous logging, allowing you to log messages without blocking your application's execution. This ensures optimal performance and responsiveness.

- **Helpful Macros**: The library provides a set of convenient macros that simplify common logging tasks, such as creating log entries, printing logs to stdout, logging to files, and conditionally logging based on feature flags or predicates.
