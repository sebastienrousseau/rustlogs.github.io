## Usage

### How do I add RustLogs (RLG) to my Rust project?

To add RustLogs (RLG) to your Rust project, simply add the following line to your `Cargo.toml` file:

```toml
[dependencies]
rlg = "0.0.3"
```

### How do I create a new log entry?

To create a new log entry using RustLogs (RLG), you can use the `Log::new()` function:

```rust
use rlg::log::Log;
use rlg::log_format::LogFormat;
use rlg::log_level::LogLevel;

let log_entry = Log::new(
    "12345",
    "2023-01-01T12:00:00Z",
    &LogLevel::INFO,
    "MyComponent",
    "This is a sample log message",
    &LogFormat::JSON,
);
```

### How do I log a message asynchronously?

To log a message asynchronously using RustLogs (RLG), you can use the `log()` method on a log entry:

```rust
tokio::runtime::Runtime::new().unwrap().block_on(async {
    log_entry.log().await.unwrap();
});
```

### How can I customize the log file path?

By default, RustLogs (RLG) logs to a file named "RLG.log" in the current directory. You can customize the log file path by setting the `LOG_FILE_PATH` environment variable:

```rust
std::env::set_var("LOG_FILE_PATH", "/path/to/log/file.log");
```

## Macros

### What macros are available in RustLogs (RLG)?

RustLogs (RLG) provides several helpful macros to simplify common logging tasks:

- `macro_log!`: Creates a new log entry with specified parameters.
- `macro_info_log!`: Creates an info log with default session ID and format.
- `macro_print_log!`: Prints a log to stdout.
- `macro_log_to_file!`: Asynchronously logs a message to a file.
- `macro_warn_log!`: Creates a warning log.
- `macro_error_log!`: Creates an error log with default format.
- `macro_set_log_format_clf!`: Sets the log format to CLF if not already defined.
- `macro_debug_log!`: Conditionally logs a message based on the `debug_enabled` feature flag.
- `macro_trace_log!`: Creates a trace log.
- `macro_fatal_log!`: Creates a fatal log.
- `macro_log_if!`: Conditionally logs a message based on a predicate.
- `macro_log_with_metadata!`: Logs a message with additional metadata.

### How do I use the `macro_log!` macro?

The `macro_log!` macro allows you to create a new log entry easily. Here's how you can use it:

```rust
let log = macro_log!(session_id, time, level, component, description, format);
```

### How do I use the `macro_info_log!` macro?

The `macro_info_log!` macro creates an info log with default session ID and format. Here's how you can use it:

```rust
let log = macro_info_log!(time, component, description);
```

### How do I conditionally log a message based on a predicate?

You can use the `macro_log_if!` macro to conditionally log a message based on a predicate:

```rust
macro_log_if!(predicate, log);
```

If the `predicate` evaluates to `true`, the log message will be printed using `macro_print_log!`.

## Error Handling

### How does RustLogs (RLG) handle errors during logging operations?

Errors can occur during logging operations, such as file I/O errors or formatting errors. The `log()` method returns a `Result<(), io::Error>` that indicates the outcome of the logging operation. You should handle potential errors appropriately in your code:

```rust
match log_entry.log().await {
    Ok(_) => println!("Log entry successfully written"),
    Err(err) => eprintln!("Error logging entry: {}", err),
}
```
